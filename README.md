Hi!

Welcome to my app, Health Nut! The app designed to tell you, EVERYTHING about the foods you are eating and may want to eat!

The current version of the app accepts two parameters, a food item and a measurement of the food (i.e one cup of soup or one bowl of chicken noodle soup both are accepted). 

The parameters are fairly fluid, most mass measurements are accepted for solid foods and likewise volumetric measurements work for liquids. 

In addition, if no measurement is input, a food can be referenced by its serving size (i.e 3 steaks will bring up the nutritional value for 3 serving sizes of steak). 

Once you are satisfied with the food you have input, a nutritional list will be output that lists a majority of the nutrients inside the combined total of the input items. 

The app was designed to help shed light on non common nutritional items in a persons diet, so that the individual may himself see what nutrients he is taking in excess or deficit.

It can also be used as a for fun app to see extreme examples of what drinking "400 redbulls" will add to the nutrient pool of an individual, without actually trying it!
